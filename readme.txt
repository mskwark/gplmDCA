This is a MATLAB-implementation of the asymmetric version of gplmDCA.
The program uses 'minFunc' by Mark Schmidt (contained in the folder '3rd_party_code'), which can be found at http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/minFunc.html.
 
Inputs to gplmDCA: 
	fastafile:
	Alignment file in FASTA format. Inserts, which should be represented by '.' and lower-case letters (as is standard in the Pfam download), are removed automatically by the program.

	outputfile:
	This becomes a file with N(N-1)/2 rows (N=domain length), each with three entries: residue i, residue j, and interaction score for the pair (i,j).

	lambda_h:
	Field-regularization strength (typical value: 0.01).

	lambda_J:
	Coupling-regularization strength (typical value: 0.01 - this is tested for N in the range 50-100 or so, and the optimal value may be different for longer domains).

	lambda_chi:
	Gap-regularization strength (typical value 0.001).

	reweighting_threshold:
	Required fraction of nonidentical AA for two sequences to be counted as independent (typical values: 0.1-0.3).
	Note that this is not the threshold 'x' as defined in the paper, but 1-x.
 	
	nr_of_cores:
	The number of processors to use on the local machine. 
	If this argument is >1, the program calls functions from MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox.

	M:
	Maximal gap length for gap parameters. 
	If set to -1, it will be chosen automatically, otherwise only gaps with length [1, M] will be affected. Unless
	you have a good reason to do so, we recommend setting M to -1.
	

Typical call (on a quad-core machine):
	plmDCA_asymmetric('alignment.fas','alignment.gplmdca',0.01,0.01,0.1,4)
